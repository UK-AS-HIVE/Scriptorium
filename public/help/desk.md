#Using Desk  


Desk is where you do your work.  It has an image-viewer for displaying manuscript images, and a document editor for creating transcriptions, notes, or whatever document you want to associate with the manuscript images you have opened in the viewer.


#The image-viewer, its functions and icons.


To open a manuscript in the viewer, go to “Load Window” on the right side of the black navigation bar.  You will find a drop-down menu listing the available manuscripts.  [Note: Please contact us if there is a manuscript you want in the viewer, and we shall see whether it is possible to obtain and display it for you.]  Click on the shelfmark of the manuscript you want to view.  A viewer window will open on your desk, with the image of the manuscript in it.  It may take a few seconds to load the image.
