# Scriptorium

[Introductory Video](http://www.rch.uky.edu/scriptoriumoverview.html)

Scriptorium is a digital environment for collaborative research on manuscripts, of any era or language. 

Scriptorium offers a powerful and flexible viewer for studying manuscript images:  zoom, pan, compare multiple images on a single screen, annotate the images to draw attention to specific features in script, layout, and illustrations.

Scriptorium also allows collaborators to work together in real time on documents relating to their project, and to display to each other their discoveries in real time. 

Scholarly resources related to the project can be uploaded, stored, shared, and opened for viewing alongside manuscript images. 

Images can be displayed in the Scriptorium interface from any repository that publishes its images online using [IIIF](http://iiif.io) protocols. 

### Installation
Scriptorium was built with [Meteor](http://www.meteor.com). 

To get started:
```
git clone https://github.com/UK-AS-HIVE/Scriptorium.git Scriptorium/
cd Scriptorium
meteor
```

Once the server is up and running, users can create accounts and projects, and begin loading manifests from their preferred repositories. A contextual help system is available for navigating individual features of Scriptorium.
