# Scriptorium

Scriptorium is an open-source, collaborative manuscript tool built with [Meteor](http://meteor.com).

Scriptorium aims to provide a collaborative space for viewing, annotating, and transcribing manuscripts available in [IIIF](http://iiif.io) manifests. In addition to image viewing and annotation features, Scriptorium provides user accounts and a project system containing project-specific chat, file uploads, and document editing. 

To get started:
```
git clone https://github.com/UK-AS-HIVE/Scriptorium.git Scriptorium/
cd Scriptorium
meteor
```

Once the server is up and running, users can create accounts and projects, and begin loading manifests from their preferred repositories. A contextual help system is available for navigating individual features of Scriptorium.
