      <h3>You are now in your Scriptorium.</h3>

      <p>There is a navigation bar at the top of the page.
      You can also click on the colored elements in the image to the right to get to the elements of Scriptorium.</p>

      <p>
        To begin a new project, click "Create New Project" on the right side of the navigation bar. From there, you can furnish the project with manuscript images and research materials of your choice. After creation, you may wish to invite other researchers to the project as collaborators, using the {{#if isntPersonalProject}}<a href="/collaboration" class="color-darkgray">Collaboration</a>{{else}}Collaboration{{/if}} link.
        {{#unless isntPersonalProject}} Since you are currently in your personal project, you cannot invite in collaborators - you'll need to create a new project first.{{/unless}}
      </p>

      <p>The <a href="/desk" class="color-blue">Desk</a> is where you can study images of manuscripts, create documents, and annotate the manuscript images.  If you have invited collaborators to your project and given them permission to edit materials, you and they can work collaboratively on documents and annotations. Documents created in <a href="/desk" class="color-blue">Desk</a> can be saved, stored in <a href="/files" class="color-green">File Cabinet</a>, or exported.</p>

      <p>The <a href="/files" class="color-green">File Cabinet</a> is where you can store documents created in <a href="/desk" class="color-blue">Desk</a>. You and your collaborators can also upload documents and PDF files of research materials to share. You can provide a brief description of each file and its reason for being there. <a href="/files" class="color-green">File Cabinet</a> titles and descriptions are searchable.</p>

      <p>The <a href="/bookshelf" class="color-red">Bookshelf</a> is where you and your collaborators can assemble reference works you want to have readily available as you work on your project. They can be online resources for which you provide URLs or URIs, or they can be PDF files you upload. You can arrange the order of the resources on the “shelves” according to your preference by dragging and dropping the “books” you create; you can also put whatever names you like for the resources on the “spines” of the “books”, and also choose whatever colors you like, using the color picker, to help you organize the categories of your resources.</p>

      <p>The {{#if isntPersonalProject}}<a href="/collaboration" class="color-darkgray">Collaboration</a>{{else}}Collaboration{{/if}} page is where you can invite colleagues who have Scriptorium accounts to join specific projects as collaborators.  You can also remove members from your research team. The {{#if isntPersonalProject}}<a href="/collaboration" class="color-darkgray">Collaboration</a>{{else}}Collaboration{{/if}} page also has a Communication panel, where you and your collaborators can leave messages for each other. Messages can be threaded by subject, and also are fully searchable.{{#unless isntPersonalProject}} Your personal project (named by your given name: <strong>{{fullName}}</strong>) has no collaborative space. You will need to create a new project to begin collaborating with others.{{/unless}}</p>
