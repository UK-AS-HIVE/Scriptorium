  <h1>Using Desk</h1>
  <p>
    Desk is where you do your work.  It has an image viewer for displaying manuscript images, and a document editor for creating transcriptions, notes, or whatever document you want to associate with the manuscript images you have opened in the viewer.

      Repositories
    {{/helpPanelHeading}}
    {{#helpPanelBody id="help-desk-add-manifest"}}
      <p>Scriptorium can only display images for which there is a IIIF manifest. Use of the IIIF standard is increasing, and a number of digital repositories are generously publishing their manifests. The environment is changing rapidly and unpredictably. "Repositories" offers a few suggestions to help project leaders quickly find a few major repositories that in 2016 have published manifests.</p>

      <p>To add images to a project, go to a digital repository that has published IIIF manifests (the link to a manifest has a red and blue icon: <img style="height: 20px; width: 22px;" src="/help/icons/iiif.png">), and copy the manifest link for a particular manuscript. Then go to Desk --&gt; Load Manuscript, and click on the + below the drop-down list of available images. A dialogue box will appear. Paste the manifest URL into the URL box, name the manuscript, and enter location (we recommend noting the name of the digital repository, but this is a free-form field). Click save. The manuscript images will be added to the drop-down list in Load Manuscript for that project. Because the list can become unwieldy and is primitive in organization, we recommend restraint in populating it.</p>

    {{#helpPanelBody id="help-desk-load-window"}}

      To open a manuscript in the viewer, go to “Load Manuscript” on the right side of the black navigation bar.  You will find a drop-down menu listing the available manuscripts.  [Note: Please contact us if there is a manuscript you want in the viewer, and we shall see whether it is possible to obtain and display it for you.]  Click on the shelfmark of the manuscript you want to view.  A viewer window will open on your desk, with the image of the manuscript in it.  It may take a few seconds to load the image.

      Using Desk Collaboratively
    {{/helpPanelHeading}}
    {{#helpPanelBody id="help-desk-using-collaboratively"}}
      <p>When collaborators are working on a shared project, each has his or her own arrangement and selection of images and documents on Desk. Each collaborator can create new documents and can annotate images. When two or more collaborators are working on the same document, the document is shared in real time, and all additions, deletions, and changes are visible to those with the document open.</p>
      <p>Only one person can type in any given moment. Another collaborator can type after a.) there is inactivity in the document for 30 seconds, or b.) the typing collaborator clicks "Save". "Save" unlocks the document so that others can edit it. A message appears next to the "Save" button informing all collaborators who is typing at any given moment.</p>
      <p>Documents created in Desk for a project are available to all collaborators and are updated for all collaborators: any changes, made by any collaborator, update the document for all collaborators. If a collaborator wants an independent document, he or she should create a new one.</p>
      <p>Documents are automatically named with the shelfmark and folio or page number of the image whose Document Editor icon was clicked. They can be renamed. There is no inherent or persistent association of the document with the image; the pre-populated name is intended to be only for convenience.</p>
      <p>Any document created in Desk is automatically saved in File Cabinet, along with any documents that collaborators may have uploaded to File Cabinet. To find project documents, you may either go to File Cabinet, or you can click on "Open Document" when you are in desk. "Open Document" launches a side panel in Desk that lists the contents of File Cabinet.</p>
      <p>To share views of each collaborator's Desk, use Snapshot.</p>

      Snapshots
    {{/helpPanelHeading}}
    {{#helpPanelBody id="help-desk-snapshot"}}
      <p>Snapshot allows collaborators to display views of their individual Desk arrangements, so that useful combinations of images and documents can be shared. When a collaborator clicks Create Snapshot, a dialogue box appears for naming the image of that collaborator's Desk, as it is arranged at that moment (image selection, position, zoom status, open documents). The named Snapshot will automatically be reported in the Chat stream for all collaborators. NOTE: Clicking on the Snapshot name in the Chat stream will transform one's own Desk into the Snapshot arrangement of the collaborator's Desk! If you want to preserve your own Desk arrangement before looking at the named Snapshot, Create Snapshot of your own Desk so that you can return to it by clicking on your own, named Snapshot.</p>
      <p>Once you have switched to a Snapshot arrangement of Desk, all elements are dynamic, as usual. You may resize image and document frames, and drag them around, and close them. You may annotate images, create new documents, and work on existing documents. NOTE: Documents continue to be updated synchronously for all collaborators, regardless of Desk arrangement. That is, whether or not you choose to view a Snapshot arrangement, you will see updated documents, and can edit a document that two or more collaborators have open at the same time.</p>

      Interacting With Images
    {{/helpPanelHeading}}
    {{#helpPanelBody id="help-desk-image-interaction"}}
      <p>You can resize the viewer window by dragging its edges.  You can move the viewer window around on your desk by dragging it with a click on the top, grey border.  You can open multiple windows and drag them around to put them in whatever configuration suits your purpose.</p>

      <p>In the top border of the viewer window are icons for viewer actions.</p>

      <p>On the left are <img src="/images/openseadragon/zoom-in.png"> zoom to enlarge image, <img src="/images/openseadragon/zoom-out.png"> zoom to reduce image, <img src="/images/openseadragon/fit-hover.png"> to return to the initial view of the image.  You can also zoom in and out, and pan the image, by mouse movements over the image itself.</p>

      <p>On the right, the icons are:</p>
      <div class="panel-group" id="help-desk-icons-accordtion" role="tablist">
        <div class="panel panel-default">
          {{#helpPanelHeading id="help-desk-annotations"}}
            <img class="mirador-btn mirador-icon-annotations">Annotation Panel
          {{/helpPanelHeading}}
          {{#helpPanelBody id="help-desk-annotations"}}
            <p>To annotate an image by drawing boxes around particular features or areas in the image and associating textual description with that box, click on the Annotation icon <img class="mirador-btn mirador-icon-annotations"> in the image frame. An Annotation Panel will open to the right of the image. In the Panel, you will see a list of all annotations that have been made on the image you are viewing. The list is only of annotations for that page; to see annotations on another page of the manuscript, advance the image to the new page. The list of annotations can be filtered with the dropdown menu in the Annotation Panel, so that you can view only "commentary" annotations (likely to be used for comments on paleographic features or problems) or "transcriptions" (for those who wish to use Annotations, rather than regular documents, for transcriptions), or you may view all types. Mousing over an annotation in the list highlights the annotation box on the image, for ready location of the feature. Mousing over the box on the image displays the annotation in its editor frame. The editor frame can be opened for further editing (some may wish to have collaborative discussion in these annotations).</p>

            <p>To create an annotation, click on the <img class="mirador-btn mirador-icon-annotorius"> in the Annotation Panel, right below the dropdown menu. Each new annotation requires a new click on that icon. You will be prompted to click and drag your cursor to form the desired box, which will be green as you position it, and will turn red when you release the cursor to set the final form of the box. To add description, mouse over the box: a document editor will appear. Type your annotation in the editing box. At the bottom of the editor frame, you are offered a choice of "commentary" or "transcription": this is the category in which your annotation will be displayed in the Annotation List (see above). When you are satisfied with your description, click Save. The box and description will appear when you or a collaborator mouse over that region, or when you open the Annotations list by clicking on the Annotations icon <img class="mirador-btn mirador-icon-annotations"> in the image frame.</p>

            <p>Future features, not yet implemented: To publish annotated images in a public exhibit, click on the paper airplane of an image frame that has annotations: the image and its annotations will be copied to Exhibit Builder, where you can add the metadata and longer commentaries for the images you want to publish. In the future, it will also be possible to download annotations, with the co-ordinates of the box on the image, although it will not be possible to download the image itself.</p>

          {{/helpPanelHeading}}
          {{#helpPanelBody id="help-desk-metadata"}}
            Clicking this icon displays information about the manuscript image you are viewing, such as a short notice of the content, the holding repository, permissions, and technical information about the IIIF manifest for image delivery.

          {{#helpPanelBody id="help-desk-scroll"}}
            Clicking this icon will load a scrollable panel with thumbnail images of all the pages in the manuscript you are viewing. This panel allows you to browse all the pages in your manuscript. Once the thumbnail images are visible, you can select one to open it in the usual full, zoomable view for study or annotation. NOTE: The Scroll View requests a large amount of data from the repository's server, and may take several seconds to load fully.

          {{#helpPanelBody id="help-desk-thumbnail"}}
            Clicking on this icon opens a new panel of tiled, thumbnail images of the pages of the manuscript you are viewing. Clicking on one of those thumbnails opens the image of that page in a new viewer window on your desk. NOTE: Much like the Scroll View, the Thumbnails View loads a number of images at once from the repository's server, and will take some time to load.

          {{#helpPanelBody id="help-desk-editor-icon"}}
            Clicking this icon will prompt you to name a new document, to be opened in a document editor on your Desk. In the document editor, you can create rich text documents (that is, documents with various fonts and formatting features, including the option to type right-to-left for Hebrew, Syriac, etc.), much as you would with a text editor such as Word. These documents are by default named for the shelfmark of the manuscript you are viewing, but will have no inherent connection to a specific manuscript or page displayed in the image viewer. You may rename the document at any time.

      <p>The chat stream presents a combination of collaborator's comments and automatically generated notices of particular events, such as when a collaborator creates a Snapshot to share, or adds a new member to a project, or adds an item to File Cabinet. Chat is useful for quick decisions about tasks, or instant reports of ideas, discoveries, or problems.</p>
      <p>For less ephemeral, more substantive reports and planning, Collaboration has a discussion forum. It supports threaded discussion and is searchable.</p>
